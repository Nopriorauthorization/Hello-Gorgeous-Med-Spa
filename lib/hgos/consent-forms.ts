        <p><strong>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
        <p>This agreement affects your legal rights. By signing this agreement, you are agreeing to have any dispute arising out of the healthcare services you receive at this facility resolved by neutral binding arbitration rather than a jury trial.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>1. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</h3>
      <p>It is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice, that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered, will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by Illinois law, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process, except as Illinois law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings.</p>
      
      <h3>2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT</h3>
      <p>This agreement covers all claims arising out of or relating to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any treatment or procedure performed at Hello Gorgeous Med Spa</li>
        <li>Any products sold or recommended by Hello Gorgeous Med Spa</li>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES</h3>
      <p>All disputes subject to arbitration shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) for healthcare disputes. The arbitration shall take place in Kendall County, Illinois, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties.</p>
      
      <h3>4. SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR</h3>
      <p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an attorney with experience in medical malpractice law. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, in accordance with AAA rules.</p>
      
      <h3>5. COSTS AND FEES</h3>
      <p>Each party shall bear their own costs and attorney's fees. The costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees, shall be shared equally by the parties, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.</p>
      
      <h3>6. BINDING DECISION</h3>
      <p>The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
      
      <h3>7. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</h3>
      <p><strong>BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</strong> You understand that you have the right to have any medical malpractice claim decided by a jury, and you are voluntarily giving up that right in favor of binding arbitration.</p>
      
      <h3>8. VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT</h3>
      <p>I understand that I am not required to sign this agreement as a condition of receiving treatment. I am signing this agreement voluntarily, and I have had the opportunity to seek legal counsel before signing.</p>
      
      <h3>9. RIGHT TO RESCIND</h3>
      <p>I understand that I have the right to rescind (cancel) this agreement within 30 days of signing by providing written notice to Hello Gorgeous Med Spa. After 30 days, or after receiving treatment, whichever comes first, this agreement cannot be rescinded.</p>

      <h3>1. NATURE OF TREATMENT</h3>
      <p>I understand that a chemical peel involves the application of a chemical solution to the skin to remove damaged outer layers and stimulate new skin growth. The type and strength of peel will be determined by my provider based on my skin condition and goals.</p>
